# Attack on Titans Game
Attack on Titan: Utopia is a Java/JavaFX tower-defense game in which you defend your walls against waves of Titans by purchasing and deploying weapons across multiple lanes. You begin by choosing Easy (3 lanes, more resources) or Hard (5 lanes, fewer resources). Each lane displays its danger level, wall HP, weapons you’ve placed, and Titans advancing toward your wall. Between turns you earn resources to spend in a weapon shop offering four distinct options—Piercing Cannon, Sniper Cannon, Volley Spread Cannon, and Wall Trap—each with its own cost, damage, and tactical role. Titans come in four classes (Pure, Abnormal, Armored, Colossal), each with unique health, speed, and behavior. Images are cached to maintain performance, and robust exception handling prevents crashes. When any wall falls, a full-window Game Over screen appears with a “Return to Homepage” button.
